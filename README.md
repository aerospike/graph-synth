Aerospike GraphSynth is a high performance parallel synthesizer for graph-structured data.

GraphSynth takes a Schema Graph and a Scale Factor and emits a Graph fitting the input Schema, scaled to Scale Factor size

You can find some examples of writing to a [TinkerPop Graph](script/example.sh) or writing to a [directory of CSV files](conf/generator/generateToCSVFiles.properties). 

A tutorial on writing a Schema can be found [here](docs/SchemaGraph.md)

NOTE: GraphSynth is intended for testing and pre-production environments. It is not recommended for production operations.
